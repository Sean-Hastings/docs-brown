# Estimating Height with the Infrared Sensor {#sensors-assignment-infrared-theory status=draft}

The infrared (IR) sensor on your PiDrone outputs a voltage $V$. This voltage has a inverse relationship with your drone's height $h$ (when $h$ is between .1 and .6 meters). So, we can say that 

\[ 
    h = m\frac{1}{V} + b
\]

for some $m$ and $b$.

## Questions
1. Given two ordered pairs that satisfy this relationship, $(V_1, h_1)$ and $(V_2, h_2)$, what are the values of $m$ and $b$ in the equation?
